                    <p>This a beginner's version of Blackjack without the betting to better demonstrate the card play.  The object of the game:  Player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.</p>
                    <p> Card values: An ace is worth 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its number value.</p>
                    <p>The game: After each player has been dealt the first player must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). A player can lose if it is 21 or under, or goes "bust" (if it is over 21) and the dealer's hand is 21.</p>
